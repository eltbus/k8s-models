Match conditions filter requests that have already been matched by the rules, namespaceSelector, and objectSelector. An empty list of matchConditions matches all requests. There are a maximum of 64 match conditions allowed.  If a parameter object is provided, it can be accessed via the `params` handle in the same manner as validation expressions.

Each variable is defined as a named CEL expression. The variables defined here will be available under `variables` in other expressions of the policy except MatchConditions because MatchConditions are evaluated before the rest of the policy.  The expression of a variable can refer to other variables defined earlier in the list but not those after. Thus, Variables must be sorted by the order of first appearance and acyclic. """)
